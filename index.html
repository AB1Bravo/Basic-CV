  <a id="Employment">Previous Employment:</a>
</h2>
<p>Print Connections: Customer Service Advisor [April 2019 - June 2019]</p>
<p>My role as a customer service advisor entailed to assist customers daily, both in the store and over the phone. I took customer orders for small businesses, assisted with customer payments or accounts.</p>
<p>I always ensured that the shop floor looked presentable and stocked up with the goods such as paper and ink. As a customer service advisor my main role was to provide a quick and efficient service and ensure the customers were happy with the service provided.</p>

<h2><a id="Volunteer">Volunteer Experience or Leadership</a></h2>
<p>Genesis Housing Association [23rd October 2017 - 31st October 2017]</p>
<p>My role within my team was to design a flat within a certain budget, as well as it being completed within the time frame given due to the work experience being 5 days. There were multiple projects that had to be completed within the set deadlines, with many people working alongside this project therefore, I experienced some form of a fast-paced environment, paying attention to even the slightest detail to ensure everything is correct.
From this experience I gained a lot of experience as well as achieving a certificate for the best student worker. This award was given to the best student that was the most hardworking, beneficial, and productive. This experience taught me how to work in a fast-paced environment as well as how to stay calm in pressurized situations.
</p>
<p>The Village School [15th June 2015 - 15th June 2015]</p>
<p>Assisting the teachers in classes with the students who have special needs and disabilities, providing help to students with their work and activities. This was my first time working in a fast-paced environment as there were staff shortages, meaning that I was required to assist in various departments throughout the day, such as the school office and library.  I ensured that I took the responsibility to assist all students where possible taking care of their needs and making them feel comfortable in their class environment. The above experience was very interesting and I felt fortunate to be able to help these children.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police Service - Volunteer Police Cadet [May 2016 - May 2020]</p>
<p>Over the last five years I have been part of the Metropolitan Police Volunteer Police Cadets. In September 2018, I obtained the rank of a Team Leader, this role consisted of various opportunities such as, training new cadets, Co-ordinating the drill (marching). I was also given the task of presenting PowerPoints and briefings alongside the police sergeant. There were also administrative tasks such as ordering cadet uniforms, organizing events etc.</p>
